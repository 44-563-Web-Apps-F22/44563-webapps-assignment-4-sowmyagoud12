    <h4 class="JULIA">Enter JULIA JELLICOE.</h4><br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Herr Dummkopf, a word with you, if you please.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> Beautiful English maiden—</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> No compliments, I beg. I desire to speak with you<br>
    on a<br>
    purely professional matter, so we will, if you please, dispense<br>
    with<br>
    allusions to my personal appearance, which can only tend to widen<br>
    the<br>
    breach which already exists between us.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> (aside). My only hope shattered! The haughty<br>
    Londoner<br>
    still despises me! (Aloud.) It shall be as you will.</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> I understand that the conspiracy in which we are<br>
    all<br>
    concerned is to develop to-morrow, and that the company is likely<br>
    to elect you to the throne on the understanding that the posts<br>
    about the Court are to be filled by members of your theatrical<br>
    troupe, according to their professional importance.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> That is so.</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Then all I can say is that it places me in an<br>
    extremely awkward position.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> (very depressed). I don't see how it concerns you.</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Why, bless my heart, don't you see that, as your<br>
    leading lady, I am bound under a serious penalty to play the<br>
    leading part in all your productions?</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> Well?</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Why, of course, the leading part in this production<br>
    will be the Grand Duchess!</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> My wife?</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> That is another way of expressing the same idea.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> (aside—delighted). I scarcely dared even to hope<br>
    for<br>
    this!</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Of course, as your leading lady, you'll be mean<br>
    enough to hold me to the terms of my agreement. Oh, that's so<br>
    like a man! Well, I suppose there's no help for it—I shall have<br>
    to do it!</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> (aside). She's mine! (Aloud.) But—do you really</p><br>
    think you would care to play that part? (Taking her hand.)<br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> (withdrawing it). Care to play it? Certainly<br>
    not—but what am I to do? Business is business, and I am bound<br>
    by the terms of my agreement.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> It's for a long run, mind—a run that may last many,<br>
    many years—no understudy—and once embarked upon there's no<br>
    throwing it up.</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Oh, we're used to these long runs in England: they<br>
    are the curse of the stage—but, you see, I've no option.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> You think the part of Grand Duchess will be good<br>
    enough for you?</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> Oh, I think so. It's a very good part in<br>
    Gerolstein, and oughtn't to be a bad one in Pfennig Halbpfennig.<br>
    Why, what did you suppose I was going to play?</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> (keeping up a show of reluctance) But, considering<br>
    your strong personal dislike to me and your persistent rejection<br>
    of my repeated offers, won't you find it difficult to throw<br>    
    tenderness, adoration, devotion—all in luxuriant excess, and all<br>
    of the most demonstrative description.</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> My good sir, throughout my career I have made it a<br>
    rule never to allow private feeling to interfere with my<br>
    professional duties. You may be quite sure that (however<br>
    distasteful the part may be) if I undertake it, I shall consider<br>
    myself professionally bound to throw myself into it with all the
    ardour at my command.</p><br>
    <h4 class="ERN">ERN.</h4><p class="speech1"> (aside—with effusion). I'm the happiest fellow<br>
    alive!<br>
    (Aloud.) Now—would you have any objection—to—to give me some<br>
    idea—if it's only a mere sketch—as to how you would play it?<br>
    It would be really interesting—to me—to know your conception<br>
    of—of—the part of my wife.</p><br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">JULIA.</h4><p class="speech1"> How would I play it? Now, let me see—let me see.<br>
    (Considering.) Ah, I have it!</p><br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="JULIA">BALLAD—JULIA.</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="speech1">How would I play this part—<br>
    The Grand Duke's Bride?<br>
    All rancour in my heart<br>
    I'd duly hide—<br>
    I'd drive it from my recollection<br>
    And 'whelm you with a mock affection,<br>
    Well calculated to defy detection—<br>
    That's how I'd play this part—<br>
    The Grand Duke's Bride.</p><br>
    <br>
            <h4 class="song-title">SONG—NOTARY.</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="speech1">About a century since,<br>
            The code of the duello<br>
            To sudden death<br>
            For want of breath<br>
            Sent many a strapping fellow.<br>
            The then presiding Prince<br>
            (Who useless bloodshed hated),<br>
            He passed an Act,<br>
            Short and compact,<br>
            Which may be briefly stated.<br>
            Unlike the complicated laws<br>
            A Parliamentary draftsman draws,<br>
            It may be briefly stated.</p>
