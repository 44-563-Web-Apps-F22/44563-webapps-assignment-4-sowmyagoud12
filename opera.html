            enormously wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt, and there won't be a<br>

            purely professional matter, so we will, if you please, dispense<br>

            concerned is to develop to-morrow, and that the company is likely<br>
            to elect you to the throne on the understanding that the posts<br>

            leading lady, I am bound under a serious penalty to play the<br>
            leading part in all your productions?<br>
            ERN. Well?<br>
            JULIA. Why, of course, the leading part in this production<br>
            will be the Grand Duchess!<br>
            ERN. My wife?<br>
            JULIA. That is another way of expressing the same idea.<br>
            ERN. (aside—delighted). I scarcely dared even to hope<br>
            for<br>
            this!<br>
            JULIA. Of course, as your leading lady, you'll be mean<br>
            enough to hold me to the terms of my agreement. Oh, that's so<br>
            like a man! Well, I suppose there's no help for it—I shall have<br>
            to do it!<br>
            ERN. (aside). She's mine! (Aloud.) But—do you really<br>
            think you would care to play that part? (Taking her hand.)<br>
            JULIA (withdrawing it). Care to play it? Certainly<br>
            not—but what am I to do? Business is business, and I am bound<br>
            by the terms of my agreement.<br>
            ERN. It's for a long run, mind—a run that may last many,<br>
            many years—no understudy—and once embarked upon there's no<br>
            throwing it up.<br>
            JULIA. Oh, we're used to these long runs in England: they<br>
            are the curse of the stage—but, you see, I've no option.<br>
            ERN. You think the part of Grand Duchess will be good<br>
            enough for you?<br>
            JULIA. Oh, I think so. It's a very good part in<br>
            Gerolstein, and oughtn't to be a bad one in Pfennig Halbpfennig.<br>
            Why, what did you suppose I was going to play?<br>
            ERN. (keeping up a show of reluctance) But, considering<br>
            your strong personal dislike to me and your persistent rejection<br>
            of my repeated offers, won't you find it difficult to throw<br>
            yourself into the part with all the impassioned enthusiasm that<br>
            the character seems to demand? Remember, it's a strongly<br>
            emotional part, involving long and repeated scenes of rapture,<br>
            tenderness, adoration, devotion—all in luxuriant excess, and all<br>
            of the most demonstrative description.<br>
            JULIA. My good sir, throughout my career I have made it a<br>
            rule never to allow private feeling to interfere with my<br>
            professional duties. You may be quite sure that (however<br>
            distasteful the part may be) if I undertake it, I shall consider<br>
            myself professionally bound to throw myself into it with all the
            ardour at my command.<br>
            ERN. (aside—with effusion). I'm the happiest fellow<br>
            alive!<br>
            (Aloud.) Now—would you have any objection—to—to give me some<br>
            idea—if it's only a mere sketch—as to how you would play it?<br>
            It would be really interesting—to me—to know your conception<br>
            of—of—the part of my wife.<br>
            JULIA. How would I play it? Now, let me see—let me see.<br>
            (Considering.) Ah, I have it!<br>
            <br>
            BALLAD—JULIA.
            <br>
            How would I play this part—<br>
            The Grand Duke's Bride?<br>
            All rancour in my heart<br>
            I'd duly hide—<br>
            I'd drive it from my recollection<br>
            And 'whelm you with a mock affection,<br>
            Well calculated to defy detection—<br>
            That's how I'd play this part—<br>
            The Grand Duke's Bride.<br>
            <br>
            With many a winsome smile<br>
            I'd witch and woo;<br>
            With gay and girlish guile<br>
            I'd frenzy you—<br>
            I'd madden you with my caressing,<br>
            Like turtle, her first love confessing—<br>
            That it was "mock", no mortal would be<br>
            guessing,<br>
            With so much winsome wile<br>
            I'd witch and woo!<br>
            <br>
            Did any other maid<br>
            With you succeed,<br>
            I'd pinch the forward jade—<br>
            I would indeed!<br>
            With jealous frenzy agitated<br>
            (Which would, of course, be simulated),<br>
            I'd make her wish she'd never been created—<br>
            Did any other maid<br>
            With you succeed!<br>
            <br>
            And should there come to me,<br>
            Some summers hence,<br>
            In all the childish glee<br>
            Of innocence,<br>
            Fair babes, aglow with beauty vernal,<br>
            My heart would bound with joy diurnal!<br>
            This sweet display of sympathy maternal,<br>
            Well, that would also be<br>
            A mere pretence!<br>
            <br>
            My histrionic art<br>
            Though you deride,<br>
            That's how I'd play that part—<br>

            My goodness me! What shall we do? Why, what a dreadful<br>
            situation!<br>
            (To LUD.) It's all your fault, you booby you—you lump of<br>
            indiscrimination!<br>
            I'm sure I don't know where to go—it's put me into such a<br>
            tetter—<br>
            But this at all events I know—the sooner we are off, the<br>

            SONG—LUDWIG.
            <br>
            Ten minutes since I met a chap<br>
            Who bowed an easy salutation—<br>
            Thinks I, "This gentleman, mayhap,<br>
            Belongs to our Association."<br>
            But, on the whole,<br>
            Uncertain yet,<br>
            A sausage-roll<br>
            I took and eat—<br>
            That chap replied (I don't embellish)<br>
            By eating three with obvious relish.<br>
            <br>
            CHORUS (angrily). Why, gracious powers,<br>
            No chum of ours<br>
            Could eat three sausage-rolls with relish!<br>
            <br>
            LUD. Quite reassured, I let him know<br>
            Our plot—each incident explaining;<br>
            That stranger chuckled much, as though<br>
            He thought me highly entertaining.<br>
            I told him all,<br>
            Both bad and good;<br>
            I bade him call—<br>
            He said he would:<br>
            I added much—the more I muckled,<br>
            The more that chuckling chummy chuckled!<br>
            <br>
            ALL (angrily). A bat could see<br>
            He couldn't be<br>
            A chum of ours if he chuckled!<br>
            <br>
            LUD. Well, as I bowed to his applause,<br>
            Down dropped he with hysteric bellow—<br>
            And that seemed right enough, because<br>
            I am a devilish funny fellow.<br>
            Then suddenly,<br>
            As still he squealed,<br>
            It flashed on me<br>
            That I'd revealed<br>
            Our plot, with all details effective,<br>
            To Grand Duke Rudolph's own detective!<br>
            <br>
            ALL. What folly fell,<br>
            To go and tell<br>

            You oaf immense,<br>
            With no pretence<br>
            To common sense!<br>
            A stupid muff<br>
            Who's made of stuff<br>

            Of candle-snuff!<br>

            Pack up at once and off we go, unless we're anxious to exhibit<br>
            Our fairy forms all in a row, strung up upon the Castle gibbet!<br>

            [Exeunt Chorus. Manent LUDWIG, LISA,<br>
            ERNEST, JULIA, and NOTARY.<br>
            JULIA. Well, a nice mess you've got us into! There's an<br>
            end of our precious plot! All up—pop—fizzle—bang—done for!<br>
            LUD. Yes, but—ha! ha!—fancy my choosing the Grand Duke's<br>
            private detective, of all men, to make a confidant of! When you<br>
            come to think of it, it's really devilish funny!<br>
            ERN. (angrily). When you come to think of it, it's<br>
            extremely injudicious to admit into a conspiracy every<br>
            pudding-headed baboon who presents himself!<br>
            LUD. Yes—I should never do that. If I were chairman of<br>
            this gang, I should hesitate to enrol any baboon who couldn't<br>
            produce satisfactory credentials from his last Zoological<br>
            Gardens.<br>
            LISA. Ludwig is far from being a baboon. Poor boy, he<br>
            could not help giving us away—it's his trusting nature—he was<br>
            deceived.<br>
            JULIA (furiously). His trusting nature! (To LUDWIG.) Oh,<br>
            I should like to talk to you in my own language for five<br>
            minutes—only five minutes! I know some good, strong, energetic<br>
            English remarks that would shrivel your trusting nature into<br>
            raisins—only you wouldn't understand them!<br>
            LUD. Here we perceive one of the disadvantages of a<br>
            neglected education!<br>
            ERN. (to JULIA). And I suppose you'll never be my Grand<br>
            Duchess now!<br>
            JULIA. Grand Duchess? My good friend, if you don't<br>
            produce<br>
            the piece how can I play the part?<br>
            ERN. True. (To LUDWIG.) You see what you've done.<br>
            LUD. But, my dear sir, you don't seem to understand that<br>
            the man ate three sausage-rolls. Keep that fact steadily before<br>
            you. Three large sausage-rolls.<br>
            JULIA. Bah!—Lots of people eat sausage-rolls who are not<br>
            conspirators.<br>
            LUD. Then they shouldn't. It's bad form. It's not the<br>
            game. When one of the Human Family proposes to eat a<br>
            sausage-roll, it is his duty to ask himself, "Am I a<br>
            conspirator?" And if, on examination, he finds that he is not a<br>
            conspirator, he is bound in honour to select some other form of<br>
            refreshment.<br>
            LISA. Of course he is. One should always play the game.<br>
            (To NOTARY, who has been smiling placidly through this.) What<br>
            are you grinning at, you greedy old man?<br>
            NOT. Nothing—don't mind me. It is always amusing to the<br>
            legal mind to see a parcel of laymen bothering themselves about a<br>
            matter which to a trained lawyer presents no difficulty whatever.<br>
            ALL. No difficulty!<br>
            NOT. None whatever! The way out of it is quite simple.<br>
            ALL. Simple?<br>
            NOT. Certainly! Now attend. In the first place, you two<br>
            men fight a Statutory Duel.<br>
            ERN. A Statutory Duel?<br>
            JULIA. A Stat-tat-tatutory Duel! Ach! what a crack-jaw<br>
            language this German is!<br>
            LUD. Never heard of such a thing.<br>
            NOT. It is true that the practice has fallen into abeyance<br>
            through disuse. But all the laws of Pfennig Halbpfennig run for<br>
            a hundred years, when they die a natural death, unless, in the<br>
            meantime, they have been revived for another century. The Act<br>
            that institutes the Statutory Duel was passed a hundred years<br>
            ago, and as it has never been revived, it expires to-morrow. So<br>
            you're just in time.<br>
            JULIA. But what is the use of talking to us about<br>
            Statutory<br>
            Duels when we none of us know what a Statutory Duel is?<br>
            NOT. Don't you? Then I'll explain.<br>

            SONG—NOTARY.
            <br>
            About a century since,<br>
            The code of the duello<br>
            To sudden death<br>
            For want of breath<br>
            Sent many a strapping fellow.<br>
            The then presiding Prince<br>

            He passed an Act,<br>
            Short and compact,<br>
            Which may be briefly stated.<br>
            Unlike the complicated laws<br>
            A Parliamentary draftsman draws,<br>
            It may be briefly stated.<br>
            <br>
            ALL. We know that complicated laws,<br>
            Such as a legal draftsman draws,<br>
            Cannot be briefly stated.<br>
            <br>
            NOT. By this ingenious law,<br>

            They may not fight<br>
            With falchions bright<br>

            But each a card shall draw,<br>
            And he who draws the lowest<br>
            Shall (so 'twas said)<br>
            Be thenceforth dead—<br>
            In fact, a legal "ghoest"<br>
            (When exigence of rhyme compels,<br>
            Orthography forgoes her spells,<br>
            And "ghost" is written "ghoest").<br>

            In short, to briefly sum the case,<br>
            The winner takes the loser's place,<br>
            With all its obligations.<br>
            <br>

            With all its obligations!<br>
            <br>
            LUD. I see. The man who draws the lowest card—<br>
            NOT. Dies, ipso facto, a social death. He loses all his<br>
            civil rights—his identity disappears—the Revising Barrister<br>
            expunges his name from the list of voters, and the winner takes<br>
            his place, whatever it may be, discharges all his functions, and<br>
            adopts all his responsibilities.<br>
            ERN. This is all very well, as far as it goes, but it only<br>
            protects one of us. What's to become of the survivor?<br>
            LUD. Yes, that's an interesting point, because I might be<br>
            the survivor.<br>
            NOT. The survivor goes at once to the Grand Duke, and, in<br>
            a<br>

            good<br>
            young lady, it is a beautiful maxim of our glorious Constitution<br>
            that a man can only die once. Death expunges crime, and when he<br>
            comes to life again, it will be with a clean slate.<br>

            ERN. It's not like a duel with swords. I hate a duel with<br>
            swords. It's not the blade I mind—it's the blood.<br>

            March. Enter the seven Chamberlains of the<br>
            GRAND DUKE RUDOLPH.<br>
            <br>
            CHORUS OF CHAMBERLAINS.<br>
            <br>
            The good Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig,<br>
            Though, in his own opinion, very very big,<br>
            In point of fact he's nothing but a miserable prig<br>
            Is the good Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig!<br>
            <br>
            Though quite contemptible, as every one agrees,<br>
            We must dissemble if we want our bread and cheese,<br>
            So hail him in a chorus, with enthusiasm big,<br>
            The good Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig!<br>
            <br>
            Enter the GRAND DUKE RUDOLPH. He is meanly and miserably dressed<br>
            in old and patched clothes, but blazes with a profusion of<br>
            orders and decorations. He is very weak and ill, from low<br>
            living.<br>
            <br>
            SONG—RUDOLPH.
            <br>
            A pattern to professors of monarchical autonomy,<br>
            I don't indulge in levity or compromising bonhomie,<br>
            But dignified formality, consistent with economy,<br>
            Above all other virtues I particularly prize.<br>
            I never join in merriment—I don't see joke or jape any—<br>
            I never tolerate familiarity in shape any—<br>
            This, joined with an extravagant respect for<br>
            tuppence-ha'penny,<br>
            A keynote to my character sufficiently supplies.<br>
            <br>
            (Speaking.) Observe. (To Chamberlains.) My snuff-box!<br>
            <br>
            (The snuff-box is passed with much ceremony from the Junior<br>
            Chamberlain, through all the others, until it is presented<br>
            by the Senior Chamberlain to RUDOLPH, who uses it.)<br>
        
            That incident a keynote to my character supplies.
        
            RUD. I weigh out tea and sugar with precision mathematical—
            Instead of beer, a penny each—my orders are emphatical—
            (Extravagance unpardonable, any more than that I call),
            But, on the other hand, my Ducal dignity to keep—
            All Courtly ceremonial—to put it comprehensively—
            I rigidly insist upon (but not, I hope, offensively)
            Whenever ceremonial can be practised inexpensively—
            And, when you come to think of it, it's really very
            cheap!
        
            (Speaking.) Observe. (To Chamberlains.) My handkerchief!
        
            (Handkerchief is handed by Junior Chamberlain to the next in
            order, and so on until it reaches RUDOLPH, who is much
            inconvenienced by the delay.)
        
            It's sometimes inconvenient, but it's always very cheap!
        
            RUD. My Lord Chamberlain, as you are aware, my marriage
            with the wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt will take place
            to-morrow, and you will be good enough to see that the rejoicings
            are on a scale of unusual liberality. Pass that on. (Chamberlain
            whispers to Vice-Chamberlain, who whispers to the next, and so
            on.) The sports will begin with a Wedding Breakfast Bee. The
            leading pastry-cooks of the town will be invited to compete, and
            the winner will not only enjoy the satisfaction of seeing his
            breakfast devoured by the Grand Ducal pair, but he will also be
            entitled to have the Arms of Pfennig Halbpfennig tattoo'd between
            his shoulder-blades. The Vice-Chamberlain will see to this. All
            the public fountains of Speisesaal will run with Gingerbierheim
            and Currantweinmilch at the public expense. The Assistant
            Vice-Chamberlain will see to this. At night, everybody will
            illuminate; and as I have no desire to tax the public funds
            unduly, this will be done at the inhabitants' private expense.
            The Deputy Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will see to this. All my
            Grand Ducal subjects will wear new clothes, and the Sub-Deputy
            Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will collect the usual commission on
            all sales. Wedding presents (which, on this occasion, should be
            on a scale of extraordinary magnificence) will be received at the
            Palace at any hour of the twenty-four, and the Temporary
            Sub-Deputy Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will sit up all night for
            this purpose. The entire population will be commanded to enjoy
            themselves, and with this view the Acting Temporary Sub-Deputy
            Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will sing comic songs in the
            Market-place from noon to nightfall. Finally, we have composed a
            Wedding Anthem, with which the entire population are required to
            provide themselves. It can be obtained from our Grand Ducal
            publishers at the usual discount price, and all the Chamberlains
            will be expected to push the sale. (Chamberlains bow and
            exeunt). I don't feel at all comfortable. I hope I'm not doing
            a foolish thing in getting married. After all, it's a poor heart
            that never rejoices, and this wedding of mine is the first little
            treat I've allowed myself since my christening. Besides,
            Caroline's income is very considerable, and as her ideas of
            economy are quite on a par with mine, it ought to turn out well.
            Bless her tough old heart, she's a mean little darling! Oh, here
            she is, punctual to her appointment!
        
            Enter BARONESS VON KRAKENFELDT.
        
            BAR. Rudolph! Why, what's the matter?
            RUD. Why, I'm not quite myself, my pet. I'm a little
            worried and upset. I want a tonic. It's the low diet, I think.
            I am afraid, after all, I shall have to take the bull by the
            horns and have an egg with my breakfast.
            BAR. I shouldn't do anything rash, dear. Begin with a
            jujube. (Gives him one.)
            RUD. (about to eat it, but changes his mind). I'll keep it
            for supper. (He sits by her and tries to put his arm round her
            waist.)
            BAR. Rudolph, don't! What in the world are you thinking
            of?
            RUD. I was thinking of embracing you, my sugarplum. Just
            as a little cheap treat.
            BAR. What, here? In public? Really, you appear to have
            no
            sense of delicacy.
            RUD. No sense of delicacy, Bon-bon!
            BAR. No. I can't make you out. When you courted me, all
            your courting was done publicly in the Marketplace. When you
            proposed to me, you proposed in the Market-place. And now that
            we're engaged you seem to desire that our first tte-
            occur in the Marketplace! Surely you've a room in your
            Palace—with blinds—that would do?
            RUD. But, my own, I can't help myself. I'm bound by my
            own
            decree.
            BAR. Your own decree?
            RUD. Yes. You see, all the houses that give on the
            Market-place belong to me, but the drains (which date back to the
            reign of Charlemagne) want attending to, and the houses wouldn't
            let—so, with a view to increasing the value of the property, I
            decreed that all love-episodes between affectionate couples
            should take place, in public, on this spot, every Monday,
            Wednesday, and Friday, when the band doesn't play.
            BAR. Bless me, what a happy idea! So moral too! And have
            you found it answer?
            RUD. Answer? The rents have gone up fifty per cent, and
            the sale of opera-glasses (which is a Grand Ducal monopoly) has
            received an extraordinary stimulus! So, under the circumstances,
            would you allow me to put my arm round your waist? As a source
            of income. Just once!
            BAR. But it's so very embarrassing. Think of the
            opera-glasses!
            RUD. My good girl, that's just what I am thinking of.
            Hang
            it all, we must give them something for their money! What's
            that?
            BAR. (unfolding paper, which contains a large letter,
            which
            she hands to him). It's a letter which your detective asked me
            to hand to you. I wrapped it up in yesterday's paper to keep it
            clean.
            RUD. Oh, it's only his report! That'll keep. But, I say,
            you've never been and bought a newspaper?
            BAR. My dear Rudolph, do you think I'm mad? It came
            wrapped round my breakfast.
            RUD. (relieved). I thought you were not the sort of girl
            to
            go and buy a newspaper! Well, as we've got it, we may as well
            read it. What does it say?
            BAR. Why—dear me—here's your biography! "Our Detested
            Despot!"
            RUD. Yes—I fancy that refers to me.
            BAR. And it says—Oh, it can't be!
            RUD. What can't be?
            BAR. Why, it says that although you're going to marry me
            to-morrow, you were betrothed in infancy to the Princess of Monte
            Carlo!
            RUD. Oh yes—that's quite right. Didn't I mention it?
            BAR. Mention it! You never said a word about it!
            RUD. Well, it doesn't matter, because, you see, it's
            practically off.
            BAR. Practically off?
            RUD. Yes. By the terms of the contract the betrothal is
            void unless the Princess marries before she is of age. Now, her
            father, the Prince, is stony-broke, and hasn't left his house for
            years for fear of arrest. Over and over again he has implored me
            to come to him to be married-but in vain. Over and over again he
            has implored me to advance him the money to enable the Princess
            to come to me—but in vain. I am very young, but not as young as
            that; and as the Princess comes of age at two tomorrow, why at
            two to-morrow I'm a free man, so I appointed that hour for our
            wedding, as I shall like to have as much marriage as I can get
            for my money.
            BAR. I see. Of course, if the married state is a happy
            state, it's a pity to waste any of it.
            RUD. Why, every hour we delayed I should lose a lot of you
            and you'd lose a lot of me!
            BAR. My thoughtful darling! Oh, Rudolph, we ought to be
            very happy!
            RUD. If I'm not, it'll be my first bad investment. Still,
            there is such a thing as a slump even in Matrimonials.
            BAR. I often picture us in the long, cold, dark December
            evenings, sitting close to each other and singing impassioned
            duets to keep us warm, and thinking of all the lovely things we
            could afford to buy if we chose, and, at the same time, planning
            out our lives in a spirit of the most rigid and exacting economy!
            RUD. It's a most beautiful and touching picture of
            connubial bliss in its highest and most rarefied development!
        
            DUET—BARONESS and RUDOLPH.
        
            BAR. As o'er our penny roll we sing,
            It is not reprehensive
            To think what joys our wealth would bring
            Were we disposed to do the thing
            Upon a scale extensive.
            There's rich mock-turtle—thick and clear—
        
            RUD. (confidentially). Perhaps we'll have it once a year!
        
            BAR. (delighted). You are an open-handed dear!
        
            RUD. Though, mind you, it's expensive.
        
            BAR. No doubt it is expensive.
        
            BOTH. How fleeting are the glutton's joys!
            With fish and fowl he lightly toys,
        
            RUD. And pays for such expensive tricks
            Sometimes as much as two-and-six!
        
            BAR. As two-and-six?
        
            RUD. As two-and-six—
        
            BOTH. Sometimes as much as two-and-six!
        
            BAR. It gives him no advantage, mind—
            For you and he have only dined,
            And you remain when once it's down
            A better man by half-a-crown.
        
            RUD. By half-a-crown?
        
            BAR. By half-a-crown.
        
            BOTH. Yes, two-and-six is half-a-crown.
            Then let us be modestly merry,
            And rejoice with a derry down derry.
            For to laugh and to sing
            No extravagance bring—
            It's a joy economical, very!
        
            BAR. Although as you're of course aware
            (I never tried to hide it)
            I moisten my insipid fare
            With water—which I can't abear—
        
            RUD. Nor I—I can't abide it.
        
            BAR. This pleasing fact our souls will cheer,
            With fifty thousand pounds a year
            We could indulge in table beer!
        
            RUD. Get out!
        
            BAR. We could—I've tried it!
        
            RUD. Yes, yes, of course you've tried it!
        
            BOTH. Oh, he who has an income clear
            Of fifty thousand pounds a year—
        
            BAR. Can purchase all his fancy loves
            Conspicuous hats—
        
            RUD. Two shilling gloves—
        
            BAR. (doubtfully). Two-shilling gloves?
        
            RUD. (positively). Two-shilling gloves—
        
            BOTH. Yes, think of that, two-shilling gloves!
        
            BAR. Cheap shoes and ties of gaudy hue,
            And Waterbury watches, too—
            And think that he could buy the lot
            Were he a donkey—
        
            RUD. Which he's not!
        
            BAR. Oh no, he's not!
        
            RUD. Oh no, he's not!
        
            BOTH (dancing).
            That kind of donkey he is not!
            Then let us be modestly merry,
            And rejoice with a derry down derry.
            For to laugh and to sing
            Is a rational thing-
            It's a joy economical, very!

            RUD. Oh, now for my detective's report. (Opens letter.)
            What's this! Another conspiracy! A conspiracy to depose me!
            And my private detective was so convulsed with laughter at the
            notion of a conspirator selecting him for a confidant that he was
            physically unable to arrest the malefactor! Why, it'll come
            off! This comes of engaging a detective with a keen sense of the
            ridiculous! For the future I'll employ none but Scotchmen. And
            the plot is to explode to-morrow! My wedding day! Oh,
            Caroline, Caroline! (Weeps.) This is perfectly frightful!
            What's to be done? I don't know! I ought to keep cool and
            think, but you can't think when your veins are full of hot
            soda-water, and your brain's fizzing like a firework, and all
            your faculties are jumbled in a perfect whirlpool of
            tumblication! And I'm going to be ill! I know I am! I've been
            living too low, and I'm going to be very ill indeed!
        
            SONG—RUDOLPH.
        
            When you find you're a broken-down critter,
            Who is all of a trimmle and twitter,
            With your palate unpleasantly bitter,
            As if you'd just eaten a pill—
            When your legs are as thin as dividers,
            And you're plagued with unruly insiders,
            And your spine is all creepy with spiders,
            And you're highly gamboge in the gill—
            When you've got a beehive in your head,
            And a sewing machine in each ear,
            And you feel that you've eaten your bed,
            And you've got a bad headache down here—
            When such facts are about,
            And these symptoms you find
            In your body or crown—
            Well, you'd better look out,
            You may make up your mind
            You had better lie down!
        
            When your lips are all smeary—like tallow,
            And your tongue is decidedly yallow,
            With a pint of warm oil in your swallow,
            And a pound of tin-tacks in your chest—
            When you're down in the mouth with the vapours,
            And all over your Morris wall-papers
            Black-beetles are cutting their capers,
            And crawly things never at rest—
            When you doubt if your head is your own,
            And you jump when an open door slams—
            Then you've got to a state which is known
            To the medical world as "jim-jams"
            If such symptoms you find
            In your body or head,
            They're not easy to quell—
            You may make up your mind
            You are better in bed,
            For you're not at all well!
        
            (Sinks exhausted and weeping at foot of well.)
        
            Enter LUDWIG.
        
            LUD. Now for my confession and full pardon. They told me
            the Grand Duke was dancing duets in the Market-place, but I don't
            see him. (Sees RUDOLPH.) Hallo! Who's this? (Aside.) Why, it
            is the Grand Duke!
            RUD. (sobbing). Who are you, sir, who presume to address
            me in person? If you've anything to communicate, you must fling
            yourself at the feet of my Acting Temporary Sub-Deputy Assistant
            Vice-Chamberlain, who will fling himself at the feet of his
            immediate superior, and so on, with successive foot-flingings
            through the various grades—your communication will, in course of
            time, come to my august knowledge.
            LUD. But when I inform your Highness that in me you see
            the
            most unhappy, the most unfortunate, the most completely miserable
            man in your whole dominion—
            RUD. (still sobbing). You the most miserable man in my
            whole dominion? How can you have the face to stand there and say
            such a thing? Why, look at me! Look at me! (Bursts into
            tears.)
            LUD. Well, I wouldn't be a cry-baby.
            RUD. A cry-baby? If you had just been told that you were
            going to be deposed to-morrow, and perhaps blown up with dynamite
            for all I know, wouldn't you be a cry-baby? I do declare if I
            could only hit upon some cheap and painless method of putting an
            end to an existence which has become insupportable, I would
            unhesitatingly adopt it!
            LUD. You would? (Aside.) I see a magnificent way out of
            this! By Jupiter, I'll try it! (Aloud.) Are you, by any
            chance, in earnest?
            RUD. In earnest? Why, look at me!
            LUD. If you are really in earnest—if you really desire to
            escape scot-free from this impending—this unspeakably horrible
            catastrophe—without trouble, danger, pain, or expense—why not
            resort to a Statutory Duel?
            RUD. A Statutory Duel?
            LUD. Yes. The Act is still in force, but it will expire
            to-morrow afternoon. You fight—you lose—you are dead for a
            day. To-morrow, when the Act expires, you will come to life
            again and resume your Grand Duchy as though nothing had happened.
            In the meantime, the explosion will have taken place and the
            survivor will have had to bear the brunt of it.
            RUD. Yes, that's all very well, but who'll be fool enough
            to be the survivor?
            LUD. (kneeling). Actuated by an overwhelming sense of
            attachment to your Grand Ducal person, I unhesitatingly offer
            myself as the victim of your subjects' fury.
            RUD. You do? Well, really that's very handsome. I
            daresay
            being blown up is not nearly as unpleasant as one would think.
            LUD. Oh, yes it is. It mixes one up, awfully!
            RUD. But suppose I were to lose?
            LUD. Oh, that's easily arranged. (Producing cards.) I'll
            put an Ace up my sleeve—you'll put a King up yours. When the
            drawing takes place, I shall seem to draw the higher card and you
            the lower. And there you are!
            RUD. Oh, but that's cheating.
            LUD. So it is. I never thought of that. (Going.)
            RUD. (hastily). Not that I mind. But I say—you won't
            take an unfair advantage of your day of office? You won't go
            tipping people, or squandering my little savings in fireworks, or
            any nonsense of that sort?
            LUD. I am hurt—really hurt—by the suggestion.
            RUD. You—you wouldn't like to put down a deposit,
            perhaps?
            LUD. No. I don't think I should like to put down a
            deposit.
            RUD. Or give a guarantee?
            LUD. A guarantee would be equally open to objection.
            RUD. It would be more regular. Very well, I suppose you
            must have your own way.
            LUD. Good. I say—we must have a devil of a quarrel!
            RUD. Oh, a devil of a quarrel!
            LUD. Just to give colour to the thing. Shall I give you a
            sound thrashing before all the people? Say the word—it's no
            trouble.
            RUD. No, I think not, though it would be very convincing
            and it's extremely good and thoughtful of you to suggest it.
            Still, a devil of a quarrel!
            LUD. Oh, a devil of a quarrel!
            RUD. No half measures. Big words—strong language—rude
            remarks. Oh, a devil of a quarrel!
            LUD. Now the question is, how shall we summon the people?
            RUD. Oh, there's no difficulty about that. Bless your
            heart, they've been staring at us through those windows for the
            last half-hour!
        
            FINALE.
        
            RUD. Come hither, all you people—
            When you hear the fearful news,
            All the pretty women weep'll,
            Men will shiver in their shoes.
        
            LUD. And they'll all cry "Lord, defend us!"
            When they learn the fact tremendous
            That to give this man his gruel
            In a Statutory Duel—
        
            BOTH. This plebeian man of shoddy—
            This contemptible nobody—
            Your Grand Duke does not refuse!
        
            (During this, Chorus of men and women have entered, all trembling
            with apprehension under the impression that they are to be
            arrested for their complicity in the conspiracy.)
        
            CHORUS.
        
            With faltering feet,
            And our muscles in a quiver,
            Our fate we meet
            With our feelings all unstrung!
            If our plot complete
            He has managed to diskiver,
            There is no retreat—
            We shall certainly be hung!
        
            RUD. (aside to LUDWIG).
            Now you begin and pitch it strong—walk into me abusively—
        
            LUD. (aside to RUDOLPH).
            I've several epithets that I've reserved for you
            exclusively.
            A choice selection I have here when you are ready to begin.
        
            RUD. Now you begin
        
            LUD. No, you begin—
        
            RUD. No, you begin—
        
            LUD. No, you begin!
        
            CHORUS (trembling).
            Has it happed as we expected?
            Is our little plot detected?
